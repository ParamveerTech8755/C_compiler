compiler:
converts source code to assembly and later to a file with machine code, 1's and 0's(object file)

now one source file creates one object file. These object files are stitched together along with the
libraries with the help of linker.
Linker is responsible for creating an executable file out of a cpp project.


compiler is majorly subdivided into 3 parts based on their function:
1. lexer => checks all the tokens used in the source file are indentified.
2. parsing => makes an abstract syntax tree and validates the relationship between the tokens.
3. code generation => converts this AST into assembly code.


command to build the project:(cd to src folder)
clang token.c lexer.c parser.c mycompiler.c ./include/errors.c ./include/customstring.c ./include/components/program.c ./include/components/function.c ./include/components/statement.c ./include/components/expression.c ./include/components/constant.c -o ../mycompiler

command to compile and link separately:
gcc -c /*all .c files*/
	&&
gcc -o /*all .o files*/ mycompiler
